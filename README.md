# Weather Dashboard

## Overview
A minimal weather dashboard that shows current conditions and a 3-day forecast for any city. Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and small weather icons are displayed for quick visual cues. No API key required.

## Setup
- Download the repository (or this single file export).
- Open index.html in any modern web browser.

## Usage
- Type a city name (e.g., "London") and click Search.
- View current temperature, conditions, humidity, wind, and “feels like.”
- Check the 3-day forecast table below the current section.
- Toggle units using the °C/°F switch; the dashboard refetches data to reflect the chosen units.

## Improvements from previous version (Round 2)
- Added a 3-day forecast table beneath the current weather.
- Introduced a temperature unit toggle (Celsius ⇄ Fahrenheit) that updates current and forecast values.
- Displayed small weather icons for both current conditions and forecast days.
